# Advent of Code w/ Python

Attempting to learn Python through Advent of Code.

> This project will probably be trash, based on it being my first attempt at completing any type Python code.  Feel free to shoot me some pointers!   I appreciate that there may be some design choices going on, as a result of my history with Java, when it probably doesn't follow best practices... such is life.

## Project Setup

The project is setup for primary development through VSCode Dev Containers.  I've used Dev Containers in the past for Java and Javascript, and it seemed to be a pretty comfortable method for configuration and development.  

### Annoyances

The primary issue with Python was getting the imports to work, for this I found that you can run `PYTHONPATH` in the post startup script from dev containers (thank you internet).  There is probably a better method for this, but for the simplicity of the project this seems to work.

## Year In Review

### 2024

- Day 1 - Went pretty smoothly
- Day 2 - Had to resort to iterative/slow solution for part two, will circle back to figure out a better way.
- Day 3 - Regex fun!
- Day 4 - Complete.
- Day 5 - Can't even think about part 2 at this point :(
- Day 6 - Part 2 not correct (too low), even with successful sample.  Need to come back to this after and try to get it working.
- Day 8 - Matrix and permutation management... funzi!
